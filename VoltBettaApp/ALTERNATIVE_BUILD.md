# Alternative Build Options for Volt Betta Manager

If you're having trouble with EAS CLI or prefer a different approach to building the app, here are some alternative options:

## Option 1: Use the Simplified APK Package

We've created a simplified package that includes a pre-configured Android WebView wrapper. This is essentially an Android app that loads the Volt Betta Manager web interface.

### Steps:

1. Download the `VoltBettaManager.zip` file from the project root
2. Extract the contents
3. The package contains:
   - A ready-to-install APK file
   - Web application files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - SQLite database with sample data
   - README.txt with installation instructions

### Limitations:

- This simplified version uses browser's localStorage instead of SQLite for data persistence
- Storage is limited to 5-10MB, depending on the device
- Cannot store large images directly in the database
- Data remains on the device and cannot be easily backed up

## Option 2: Build Using Android Studio

If you're familiar with Android development, you can build the app using Android Studio:

1. Download the `VoltBettaAndroidProject` folder
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Configure your signing key
4. Build the APK via Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)

### Requirements:

- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- JDK 11 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 33 or higher

## Option 3: Use Expo Go for Testing

If you just want to test the app without building an APK:

1. Install Expo Go on your Android device from Google Play Store
2. Run `npx expo start` in the VoltBettaApp directory
3. Scan the QR code with your device to open the app in Expo Go

This is the fastest way to test the app but requires an internet connection and doesn't create a standalone app.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Java Version Conflicts
- Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable points to JDK 11 or higher
- Run `javac -version` to check your current Java version

### Gradle Build Failures
- Try running `./gradlew clean` before rebuilding
- Update Gradle to the latest version

### APK Installation Issues
- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your Android settings
- Make sure your Android version is compatible (Android 7.0 or higher recommended)
