Volt Betta Manager - Installation Instructions
=============================================

This is a simplified package of the Volt Betta Manager app.
To properly install this on an Android device, you'll need to:

1. Unzip this package on your computer
2. Transfer the entire VoltBettaManager folder to your Android device
3. Install a WebView app from the Google Play Store if not already installed
4. Use a file manager on your Android device to browse to the VoltBettaManager folder
5. Open the webapp/standalone.html file with your WebView app or browser
6. For the best experience, create a shortcut to this file on your home screen

Important Tips:
- The standalone.html file works completely offline with no server required
- Your data will be saved locally on your device
- For a richer experience with the database features, use the index.html file,
  but note that it requires the full server-side components

Note: This is not a standard APK installation. For a full Android app experience, 
the project should be built using Android Studio following the instructions in the
build_instructions.md file.
